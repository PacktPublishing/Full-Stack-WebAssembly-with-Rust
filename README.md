This is the code repository for [Practical WebAssembly](https://www.packtpub.com/product/practical-webassembly/9781838828004), published by Packt.

**Explore the fundamentals of WebAssembly programming using Rust**

## What is this book about?
Rust is an open-source language tuned toward safety, concurrency, and performance. WebAssembly brings all the capabilities of the native world into the JavaScript world. Together, Rust and WebAssembly provide a way to create robust and performant web applications. They help make your web applications blazingly fast and have small binaries. Developers working with JavaScript will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to developing faster and maintainable code.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore WebAssembly and the different tools available in the WebAssembly ecosystem
* Understand the raw WebAssembly binary and the WebAssembly text format
* Use the Web and JavaScript API with wasm-bindgen
* Optimize Rust and WebAssembly for high performance
* Run and debug WebAssembly and Rust code
* Explore various tools available in the RustWASM ecosystem

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
$ touch sum.c
// sum.c
unsigned sum(unsigned a, unsigned b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for JavaScript developers who want to deliver better performance and ship type-safe code. Rust developers or backend engineers looking to build full-stack applications without worrying too much about JavaScript programming will also find the book useful.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
